# Badar Rasheed Butt - Research Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic and professional portfolio website.

The site highlights my work in:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- AI for Healthcare
- Medical Imaging Analysis
- Backend Engineering for Research-Grade Systems

## About This Portfolio

I built this portfolio to present my research direction, technical projects, publications, and professional growth in one place.

My primary focus is developing practical AI systems that can support real-world healthcare and research workflows, especially where reliability, interpretability, and performance matter.

## Core Focus Areas

- **Medical Imaging and Computational Health**
  - Deep learning for image-based disease analysis
  - Computer vision pipelines for biomedical and clinical imaging tasks
  - AI-assisted decision support for healthcare use cases

- **AI in Healthcare**
  - Multimodal learning across text, image, and clinical signals
  - NLP-driven systems for medical and research applications
  - End-to-end ML workflows from experimentation to deployment

- **Backend and Applied AI Engineering**
  - FastAPI-based production APIs
  - Model serving and inference optimization
  - Scalable architecture for research-to-production transitions

## Technical Stack

- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Data:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs, model deployment workflows
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Linux, Jupyter, LaTeX

## Website Structure

- `_pages/` - Main pages (About, CV, Portfolio, etc.)
- `_publications/` - Publication entries
- `_portfolio/` - Project highlights
- `_posts/` - Blog-style posts and updates
- `files/` - Downloadable files such as CV and PDFs

## Goal

The goal of this portfolio is to communicate my journey as a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of AI, medical imaging, and healthcare innovation.

I am especially interested in building trustworthy AI systems that create measurable impact in clinical and research settings.
